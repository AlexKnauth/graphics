# **Tamer's Handbook**

_Translating is the most complex human activity in the Universe._

`**Story:** Make a _Tamer's Handbook_ to Show the Sample`
`**In order to** standardize my development process and to make life
joyful`   `**As an** indenpendent developer`   `**I want to** write the
_handbook_ with _Literate Programming_ skill`
`**Scenario 1:** The project should provide "tamer/handbook.scrbl"`
`**Given** the project have been launched and ready for developing`
`**And** I currently have not found any appropriate specification
templates`   `**When** I do some researching and architect a template`
`**Then** I should see the "handbook.scrbl" in "tamer"`
`Hmm... the _Gherkin language_, semiformal and elegant, or maybe stupid.
Nevertheless, it's not my cup of tea...`

Since I'm an indenpendent developer and communicating costs almost
nothing, I make decision at my risk to model software system in _Formal
Methods_ and document it with the _Literate Programming_ approach. After
all this _handbook_ plays the role of the [Test
Report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven\_development) along
with the [Design
Documentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design\_by\_contract) so
that the production code could keep elegant.
