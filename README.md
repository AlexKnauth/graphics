# Digital-World

**Discipline** is the act of intentionally restricting your design choices so that you can work more productively at a higher level of abstraction.

## Project Hierarchy

How to build a digital world? Okay, we don't start with the _File Island_, but we own some concepts from the _Digimon_.

+ [**dot book**](/.book) is a mystery that sets up all the prerequistes of the world.
+ [**digimon**](/digimon) is the smallest executable unit, but they are not the top-level ones.
+ [**digitama**](/digitama) is the egg of `digimon`. Namely it works like libraries or frameworks.
+ [**d-ark**](/d-ark) is the interface for users to talk with `digimon`s. Yes, they are the top-level binaries.
+ [**tamer**](/tamer) is the interface for developers to train the _Baby_ `digimon`.
+ [**island**](/island) is the living environment of _Children_ `digimon`s.
- _nature_ defines your `digimon`'s look and feel.
- _site_ preserves the past activities of `digimon`.

Generally, `digimon`s will bear in the _Primary Village_ (which also is the root directory) from `digitama`, then they will be trained by `tamer`s.
After that they will move to `island`, and their life starts.
