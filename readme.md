## Project Conventions

### Hierarchy

How to build a _Digital World_? Okay, we don't start with the _File
Island_, but we own some concepts from the _Digimon Series_.
* **dot book** is a mystery that sets up all the prerequistes of the
  world. Sounds like `local`.
* **d-ark** is the interface for users to talk with _digimons_. Namely
  it works like `bin`.
* **village** is the birth place of _digimons_. Namely it works like
  `src`.
* **digitama** is the egg of _digimons_. Namely it works like
  `libraries` or `frameworks`.
* **island** is the living environment of _digimons_. Namely it works
  like `share` or `collection`.
  - _nature_ defines _digimons_' look and feel.
  - _stone_ stores the ancient sources to be translated.
* **tamer** is the interface for developers to train the _digimons_.
  Namely it works like `test`.

### Version

Obviousely, our _digimons_ have their own life cycle.
* [X] **Baby I** is the first stage of _digimons_ evolution straight
  from her _digitama_. Namely it's the `Alpha Version`.
