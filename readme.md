Digging data from Chaos such as iPhone Backups

## Project Conventions
* **dot book** is a mystery that sets up all the prerequistes of the
  world. Sounds like `local`.
* **d-ark** is the interface for users to talk with `digimon`s. Namely
  it works like `bin`.
* **village** is the birth place of `digimon`s. Namely it works like
  `src`.
* **digitama** is the egg of `digimon`s. Namely it works like
  `libraries` or `frameworks`.
* **island** is the living environment of `digimon`. Namely it works
  like `share` or `collection`.
  * _nature_ defines `digimon`'s look and feel.
  * _rosetta_ stores the ancient sources to be translated.
* **tamer** is the interface for developers to train the `digimon`.
  Namely it works like `test`.
